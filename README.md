# XMB-Apps

This repository bundles three small web apps under a single root directory:

## HexaPod-Sim
Static HTML/JS simulator that draws a hexapod robot on a canvas and lets users adjust joint angles through on-page controls.

## PhotographyWeb
Single-page site presenting four "journeys" as cards; selecting one reveals a tailored description and action button via simple JavaScript.

## Product-Config
Product configurator composed of `main.html`, `header.html`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, and `data/`.

- Loads `products.csv`, parses rows, and renders them in a filterable grid.
- Builds a dynamic filter menu with "Clear All Filters" support, updating available options and displayed products as selections change.

Overall, the code base is a collection of static web assets demonstrating interactive front-end prototypes for robotics simulation, photography UX exploration, and product configuration.
